            <p class="text">
                The FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world. The tournament has has been held every <strong>4 years</strong> since the inaugural tournament in 1930,
            with the exception of 1942 and 1946 due to the Second World War. As of 2022 FIFA World Cup, 22 final tournaments have been held since the event's inception, and a total of <strong>80</strong> national teams have competed. The trophy  has been won by <strong>8</strong> national teams.

        <h2 class="text-heading">Breakdown Of Tournament Rules</h2>
        <p class="text">
            The tournament Starts with the qualification phase, which takes place over the proceding <strong>3 years</strong> to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. Once in the tournament phase, <strong>32</strong> teams compete for the title at the venues (stadiums) within the host nation over the course of about <strong>1</strong> month.
            The host nation automatically qualifies for the group stage of the tournament. In the group stage, teams compete within <strong>8</strong> groups of <strong>4</strong> teams each. Eight teams are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_seeding">seeded</a>, including the hosts, with the other seeded teams selected using formula based on either, the FIFA world rankings or perfromances in recent World Cup games.
            The other teams are assigned to different "pots", usually based on different geographical criteria, and teams in each pot are drawn at random to the eight groups. Each group plays a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament">round robin tournament</a> in which each teamm is scheduled for <strong>3</strong> matches against other teasm in the same group.
            This means a total of <strong>6</strong> matches are played, the points being as follows, <strong>3</strong> for winning, <strong>1</strong> for a draw, and <strong>0</strong> for losing.
            After the matches have been played the top <strong>2</strong> teams from each group advancing to the knockout stages.
            The knockout stage is a single eloimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra times and penalty shootouts used to decide the winner if necessary.
            It begins with <strong>round of 16</strong>, in which the winner of each group plays the runner-up of another group. This is followed by the <strong>quarter-finals</strong>, <strong>semi-finals</strong>, the <strong>third-place match</strong> (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the <strong>final</strong>.
