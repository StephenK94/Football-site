                <p class="text">
                    The <strong>UEFA Champions League</strong>, as we know today was rebranded in 1992. Prior to that the competition was originally named the <strong>Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens</strong> or more commomnly the <strong>European Cup</strong>, first established in 1955.
                    It was intiailly a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with the winner reckoned as the as the European club champions. In 1991 a round-robin group stage, allowing multiple entrants form certain countries since the 1997-98 season.
                    It has since expanded further, while most of Europe's national leagues can still only enter their champion, the strongest leagues,<a href="https://www.premierleague.com/" target="_blank">Premier League</a>, <a href="https://www.laliga.com/en-GB" target="_blank">La Liga</a>, <a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga" target="_blank">Bundesliga</a>,
                    and <a href="https://www.legaseriea.it/en" target="_blank">Serie A</a> get up to <strong>Four</strong> places in the competition each.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-heading">Past Winners</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    There have been many winners of the European cup/Champions league, <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/en-US" target="_blank">Real Madrid CF</a> were the first team to ever win the Euopean cup in the 1955-56 season. They started as they mean't to continue as they are the most successful club in the competitions history.
                    There have been other successful clubs in the competition, but Real Madrid are by far the most. I have created a small illustratiom showing the most successful clubs in the tournaments history, and how many UCL trophies each of them has won, showcasing Madrids dominance throughout the competitons lifetime.

                <h2 class="text-heading">UCL Highest goalscorers</h2>
                <p class="text">
                    There have been many great players/goalscorers throughout the years to have played in the UEFA Champions League, too many to name, but
                    when talking about goalscorers in the history of the UCL, there is one name that I think springs to everyones mind, "Mr Champions League" himself, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo" target="_blank">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. This mans record for goalscoring in the competition is unbelievable!.
                    Throughout his time playing in the competition he has amassed an unrivalled collection of records.
