                <p class="text">
                    There is evidence of organized football games in both Greece and China, that date back more the <strong>2000</strong> years ago, but historians have no idea how these games were played.
                    A game that has more of a resemblance to todays football that we know and love called, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/sports/folk-football" target="_blank">"folk football"</a> had been played since medieval times with varying rules.
                    By "varying rules", I mean practically none.. as you could use any means to get the ball (inflated pigs bladder), towards your goal, markers or sometimes the balcony of the opponents' church, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder!.
                    Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century, where it became a bit more professionally regulated.
