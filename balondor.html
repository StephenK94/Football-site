                <p class="text">
                    The Balon D'or is an annual football award presented by French magazine <a href="https://francefootball.fr/" target="_blank">France Football</a> since <strong>1956</strong> to honour the player deemed to have performed the best over the previous season.
                    Concieved by sports writers <a href="https://pantheon.world/profile/person/Gabriel_Hanot" target="_blank">Gabriel Hanot</a> &amp; <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ferran" target="_blank">Jacques Ferran</a>,
                    the Ballon d'or award was based exclusively on voting by football journalists up until <strong>2006</strong>. Originally, it was awarded only to players from Europe and was widely regarded as the <strong>European Footballer of the Year</strong> award.
                    But in <strong>1995</strong>, it was expanded to include all players of any origin that have been active at European clubs. The award became a global prize in <strong>2007</strong> with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible,
                    in that same time period coaches &amp; captains of national teams were given the right to vote, but in <strong>2016</strong> it reverted back to only jornalists permitted to decide the winner.
                    Between <strong>2010</strong> &amp; <strong>2015</strong> an agreement with FIFA, the award was temporarily merged with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year" target="_blank">FIFA World Player of the Year</a>, it was known as the FIFA Balon d'or.
                    The partnership ended in <strong>2016</strong>, with both of them reverting back to individual awards. In <strong>2022</strong> France Football modified the rules,  the timing was changed so that awards were given not for achievements during a calendar year, but for a football season.
                    It was also determined that only a single journalist from each country from the <strong>top 100</strong> FIFA Men's World Ranking would be allowed to vote.

                    <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/lionel-messi/profil/spieler/28003" target="_blank">Lionel Messi</a>.. i'm sure you have heard of him, is arguably the greatest footballer to ever grace the earth (depending on who you ask).
                    As you may have seen in the list of <strong>Balon d'or</strong> winners on this page one name appears more than the rest, that name is <strong>Messi</strong>.
                    This footballing magician has won the award a record <strong>8 times</strong> more then any other player in its history!, only one other gets close to him and he is <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/cristiano-ronaldo/profil/spieler/8198" target="_blank">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>,
                    who has won it <strong>5 times</strong>. This led to the greatest fooballer rivalry that spanned nearly <strong>two decades</strong>, and between them breaking every record imaginable.

                <h4 class="aside-sub-heading">5 Times</h4>
                <p class="aside-text">
                    Ronaldo (dubbed by many the greatest player of all time), has won it <strong>5 times</strong>, first of those being in <strong>2008</strong> when he was playing in England. This was the start of <strong>15 years</strong> of back and forth between the two of them with for the most part either of them winning.
                    As mentioned above the rivalry between <strong>Ronaldo</strong> &amp; <strong>Messi</strong> has been the greatest the footballing world has ever seen and likely to see again, at least for the forseeable future.
                    So I have provided videos of the very best goals scored by each of them, I would recommend sitting back and preparing yourself to watch some of the greatest goals you're likely to see on a football pitch. Enjoy!

                <h4 class="aside-sub-heading">Pushing Each Other To Do Better</h4>
                <p class="aside-text">
                    Even though they were in direct competition for years, not only for the <strong>Balon D'or</strong> as they played in the same league, <a href="https://www.laliga.com/en-GB" target="_blank">LaLiga</a> for two of the biggest teams in the world, it was rare if you spoke/heard about one without the other. Even with the media pitting them against each other
                    at any opportunity, it was clear to all football fans that they respected each other, and arguably they may not have reached the heights that they have if not for one pushing the other to out perform and reach new heights.
